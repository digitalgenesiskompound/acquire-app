# README Update Context

## What Was Done

**Task**: Write a comprehensive README explaining project structure, Docker Compose usage, environment variables, and TODO areas.

## Changes Made

### README.md Complete Rewrite
- **From**: Basic 69-line README with minimal documentation
- **To**: Comprehensive 400+ line documentation with full project details

### Key Sections Added

1. **📁 Project Structure**: Detailed directory tree with explanations
2. **🏗️ Architecture & Technology Stack**: Backend/Frontend/Infrastructure breakdown
3. **🚀 Getting Started**: Quick start with Docker Compose emphasis
4. **⚙️ Environment Variables**: Complete table and usage examples
5. **🔧 Docker Configuration**: Multi-stage build explanation and commands
6. **🛠️ API Endpoints**: Current and planned endpoints documentation
7. **📋 TODO Areas**: Comprehensive future development roadmap
8. **🧪 Testing & Development**: Development workflow and testing instructions
9. **🔍 Troubleshooting**: Common issues and debugging approaches

### TODO Areas Documented

Based on code analysis, identified and documented the following TODO areas:

1. **WebUSB API Integration** (High Priority)
   - Location: `cmd/server/main.go` (lines 53-58)
   - Location: `web/js/app.js` (lines 13-30)
   - Planned endpoints: connect, disconnect, transfer, devices

2. **Database Integration** (High Priority)
   - PostgreSQL service ready in docker-compose.yml (commented)
   - Need connection configuration and models

3. **Authentication System** (Medium Priority)
   - JWT tokens, user management, RBAC

4. **Testing Suite** (High Priority)
   - Unit, integration, e2e tests needed

5. **Logging & Monitoring** (Medium Priority)
   - Metrics, tracing, monitoring dashboards

6. **Configuration Management** (Low Priority)
   - File-based config, validation, hot-reload

### Docker Compose Emphasis

Highlighted `docker compose up --build` as the primary build/run method per user rules about Docker containers needing rebuilds for file changes.

## Project Context

This is a Go web application for intra-oral data capture using:
- **Fiber v2** web framework (primary)
- **Gorilla Mux** (available for complex routing)
- **WebUSB integration** (planned for device communication)
- **Discord-dark theme** frontend
- **Multi-stage Docker builds** for optimization

## Files Affected

- `README.md` - Complete rewrite
- `README_UPDATE_CONTEXT.md` - This context document (new)

## Next Steps for Future Agents

The README now provides complete documentation for:
- Building and running the application
- Understanding the architecture
- Contributing to the project
- Finding areas for development (TODO sections)

All TODO areas are clearly marked with priorities and implementation details to guide future development work.
