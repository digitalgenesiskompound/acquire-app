# Acquire-App Project Overview

## Project Summary
This is a complete Go web application called "Acquire-App" designed for data acquisition and processing. The project follows Go best practices with a clean directory structure and Docker containerization support.

## Key Features Implemented

### Go Application Structure
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns with internal packages
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based config loading
- **HTTP Routing**: Using Gorilla Mux for robust routing
- **Static File Serving**: Serves CSS/JS from /static/ endpoint
- **Health Checks**: JSON-based health endpoint at /health

### Web Components
- **Responsive CSS**: Clean, modern styling with container layout
- **Interactive JavaScript**: Health check integration and basic interactivity
- **HTML Templates**: Proper HTML5 structure with meta tags

### Docker Integration
- **Multi-stage Build**: Optimized Docker image with Alpine Linux
- **Development Ready**: Docker Compose with volume mounting
- **Production Optimized**: Minimal final image size
- **Port Configuration**: Configurable port (default 8080)

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Module Name**: `acquire-app` for consistency with directory name
2. **Go Version**: 1.21 for modern Go features
3. **Dependencies**: 
   - `github.com/gorilla/mux` for HTTP routing
   - `github.com/gorilla/websocket` for future WebSocket support
4. **Internal Structure**: Following Go project layout standards
5. **Configuration**: Environment variable based with sensible defaults

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Install Go**: The system needs Go installed to run `go mod tidy`
2. **Database Integration**: Add database connection if needed
3. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication system
4. **API Endpoints**: Add data acquisition endpoints
5. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
6. **Logging**: Implement structured logging

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
```bash
go run ./cmd/server
```

### Docker Mode
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080

## Important Notes for Future Agents

- The project is ready for immediate development
- All directory structures follow Go conventions
- Docker configuration includes both development and production setups
- The CSS file already exists but was moved from the parent directory
- Internal packages use proper Go module imports
- The web assets are properly integrated with the Go server
- Health check endpoint returns proper JSON responses

This project skeleton provides a solid foundation for building a data acquisition and processing web application in Go.
