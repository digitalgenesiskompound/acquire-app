# File-by-File Implementation Guide Context

## What Was Added

**Task**: Include markdown documentation that provides best-practice and implementation explanations for each skeleton file to guide future agents.

## Implementation

### README.md Enhancement
Added a comprehensive **"📚 File-by-File Implementation Guide"** section to the main README.md containing:

### Documentation Structure

#### 🚀 **Entry Points & Core Logic**
- `cmd/server/main.go` - Detailed Fiber v2 implementation with extension points
- Graceful shutdown patterns, structured logging, middleware stack

#### ⚙️ **Configuration Management** 
- `internal/config/config.go` - Environment variable handling with best practices
- Type safety, zero dependencies, extension guidelines

#### 🎯 **Request Handling (Legacy)**
- `internal/handlers/handlers.go` - Legacy handler patterns and migration guidance
- Future integration strategies for standard library handlers

#### 🌐 **Frontend Assets**
- `web/index.html` - Semantic HTML5 with accessibility considerations
- `web/css/style.css` - Discord-dark theme color system and component architecture
- `web/js/app.js` - Event handling patterns and WebUSB integration placeholders

#### 🐳 **Containerization**
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build explanation with security considerations
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service orchestration and development workflow
- `.dockerignore` - Build optimization strategies

#### 📦 **Go Module Management**
- `go.mod` - Dependency management and versioning strategies

#### 🔄 **Development Workflow Integration**
- Critical dependencies and integration points
- Future extension areas with specific implementation guidance

## Key Features for Future Agents

### **Extension Points**
- Clear TODO markers with code examples
- WebUSB integration placeholders in both backend and frontend
- Database integration ready-to-uncomment configuration

### **Best Practices Applied**
- Security considerations (non-root containers, proper error handling)
- Performance optimizations (multi-stage builds, static compilation)
- Development workflow (Docker rebuild requirements, environment variables)

### **Implementation Patterns**
- Structured logging with slog
- Environment-based configuration
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Discord-theme CSS component system
- Event-driven JavaScript architecture

## Agent Guidance Features

### **Code Examples**
Every file explanation includes:
- Current implementation snippets
- Extension point examples
- Best practice code patterns
- Future development templates

### **Integration Flow**
Documented how files work together:
1. `config.go` → `main.go` → Environment variables
2. `web/` → Fiber static middleware → Browser  
3. Source code → Multi-stage Dockerfile → Production image
4. Code changes → `docker compose up --build` → Testing

### **Critical Dependencies**
- Web assets must be in `/web` directory
- Container rebuilds required for source changes
- Environment variables override defaults
- Health check endpoint for load balancers

## Files Modified

- `README.md` - Added comprehensive file-by-file guide (approximately 200+ lines)
- `FILE_GUIDE_CONTEXT.md` - This context document

## Future Agent Benefits

This documentation provides:
1. **Complete understanding** of each file's purpose and implementation
2. **Extension guidance** for adding new features
3. **Best practice patterns** to maintain consistency
4. **Integration awareness** to avoid breaking existing functionality
5. **Security and performance** considerations built into the design

The guide serves as a comprehensive reference that eliminates guesswork and ensures future development maintains the project's architectural integrity and best practices.
